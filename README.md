# 2lorem
### This repo contains code I used to practice. Its primary goal was to make lorem ipsum translatablel into english.

**Status**
- Code runs and yields expected results.
- Need to rework the english to lorem dictionary built in process.py to complete the project.
- I might do the above and fashion this into an API for use in the portfolio repo.
- Added a blank eng_2_(anything) for the use in future translators
- I might build a text_2_morse converter
    - reverse translator - morse to english
    - SoC project to convert/revert txt morse to light or sound based outputs and inputs
