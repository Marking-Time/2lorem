# 2lorem
### This repo contains code I used to practice. Its primary goal was to make lorem ipsum translatable into english. The .py files accept input from the command line and do the conversion.

**Status**
- Code runs and yields expected results for:
	- toLorem.py - converts text to the made up Lorem Ipsum language
	- toMorse.py - converts text to printed Morse Code
- Added a blank eng_2_(anything) for the use in future translators
    - reverse translator - morse to english
    - SoC project to convert/revert txt morse to light or sound based outputs and inputs
- eng_list.txt and lorem_list.txt are precursor files used by the process.py code to create the .json files.
